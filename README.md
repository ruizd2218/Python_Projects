This repository contains basic python projects.
Here I highlight some of the bigger projects.

Python Checkbook
My python checkbook application can be found under djangoBankingApp.
This is a web application that allows you to create an account and create your own checkbook to keep track
of expenses.

Check Files Gui
Using tkinter, a gui is made that allows you to transfer files from one folder that you can choose, to another folder
that you can choose.
